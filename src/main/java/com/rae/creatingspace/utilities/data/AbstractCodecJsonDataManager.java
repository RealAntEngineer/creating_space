/**
 * <p>See drullkus's primer on what codecs are and how to assemble them:<br>
 * https://gist.github.com/Drullkus/1bca3f2d7f048b1fe03be97c28f87910</p>
 *
 * Usage for this is as follows:</p>
 *
 * A) Make a codec for your json<br>
 * e.g. if you have a json like</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 * 	"value": "some:block"
 * }</pre>
 *
 * And we have a data class that looks like<br>
 * <pre>
 * public class BlockHolder
 * {
 * 	public final Block block;
 * 	public BlockHolder(Block block) {this.block = block;}
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Then we can make a codec via<br>
 * <pre>
 * // use the ResourceLocation codec to create a Block codec
 * Codec{@literal <Block>} BLOCK_CODEC = ResourceLocation.CODEC.xmap(ForgeRegistries.BLOCKS::getValue, Block::getRegistryName);
 * // use that to build a codec for BlockHolder. RecordCodecBuilder builds codecs that deserialize {}objects or CompoundNBTs.
 * Codec{@literal <BlockHolder>} BLOCK_HOLDER_CODEC = RecordCodecBuilder.create(instance -> instance.group(
 * 		// we can stuff up to 16 fields into the group method, using a codec for each field...
 * 		BLOCK_CODEC.fieldOf("block").forGetter(blockHolder -> blockHolder.block)
 * 	).apply(instance, BlockHolder::new); // use the constructor to finish assembling the codec
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>B) Now that we have a codec, we can register our data manager to the server as a reload listener</p>
 * <pre>
 * public static final CodecJsonDataManager{@literal <BlockHolder>} BLOCK_HOLDERS = new CodecJsonDataManager("block_holders", BLOCK_HOLDER_CODEC, LOGGER);
 * public static void onAddReloadListeners(AddReloadListenerEvent event)
 * {
 * 	event.addListener(BLOCK_HOLDERS);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * The above event runs during server init. The data manager's map will be recreated during server init and when
 * somebody uses the /reload command. Storing this in a static field should be safe in most cases, but if somebody
 * were to somehow be running multiple servers at once then problems may occur.</p>
 *
 * Finally, we can use BLOCK_HOLDERS.getData("some_modid:some_json") to get the data
 * represented by the json at data/modid/block_holders/some_json.json</p>
 *
 * The folder name that we specified as "block_holders" can potentially include subfolders in the name as well,
 * so we (the people who made the data loader) could use our own modid as part of the folder name to avoid
 * name collisions, e.g. using "blockholdermod/block_holders" as the folder name would result in a json with the
 * id "bananas:banana_block" to be located at data/bananas/blockholdermod/block_holders/some_json.json</p>
